# NikosMessenger

This is a simple messaging application that I created just for fun. It is not secure and should not be used, I just wanted to see, if I could write a working messenger 
that doesn't look completly terrible. I'll probably come back to improve security etc. but I have to learn a lot until I can do that correctly. Contributions are welcome :D Below are some pictures of the GUI <br>
